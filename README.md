# Assessment 1 Sort and Search - Lottery Application:

## Qualification: 
ICT40120 Certificate IV in Information Technology (Programming)

### Units:
- ICTPRG433 Test Software
- ICTPRG440 Apply Introductory Programming Skills in Different Languages

## Overview:
This application is a console-based program that demonstrates sorting and searching techniques in C#. The project is designed to meet the requirements of the ICT40120 assessment, allowing students to practice variable assignment, iteration, selection constructs, and working with arrays.

The application emulates a lottery-like system, where users select numbers and the program generates random numbers to compare against user selections. The number of matches is displayed to the user, demonstrating both Linear and Binary Search functionality.

## Requirements:
This sort and search application must:
1. Accept user input and store values in an array.
2. Implement custom Linear and Binary Search algorithms.
3. Restrict inputs to a predefined range of numbers.
4. Validate inputs and provide user feedback if invalid.
5. Display results clearly to the user.
6. Allow customization of:
    - Number of values entered/generated
    - Range of acceptable numbers

## Features:
- User Input & Array Storage: Users can input values into an array dynamically.
- Random Number Generator: Fills a second array with random numbers within the predefined range.
- Search Algorithms:
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
- Input Validation: Ensures only valid numbers are accepted and informs the user of any errors.
- Result Display: Shows how many numbers matched the randomly generated values.

## How to run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2019/2022.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Follow the console prompts to input numbers and view results.
